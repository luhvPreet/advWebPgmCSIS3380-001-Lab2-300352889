<!-- The starter file was given by the professor: Reza Ghaeli,
which included the index.html (contains the html template), data.js (contains the data to display), styles.css (contains the css),
this lab is supposed to display 10 users on each page using script.js,
and the number of pages increases as we add more users to an array of objects in the script.js,
it also displays the total number of users-->
